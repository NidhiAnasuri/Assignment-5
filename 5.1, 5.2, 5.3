# budget of a user
budget = int(input('Enter the budget of the month: '))
another = 'y'  # Have to add a variable?
total = 0.0
# Process one or more expenses
while another == 'y' or another == 'Y':
    # expenses
    expenses = float(input('Enter the expenses: '))
    total += expenses
   
    another = input('Do you have another expenses? ' +
                    '(Enter y for yes, enter n for no): ')
    break
if total > budget:
    print(f'You are ${total - budget} over the budget ')
elif total == budget:
    print(f'Your budget is enough for expenses!')
else:
    print(f'You are ${total - budget} under the budget ')

print(f'Total: ${total}')

total = 0.0
# Process one or more expenses
while another == 'y' or another == 'Y':
    # expenses
    expenses = float(input('Enter the expenses: '))
    total += expenses
    # again
    another = input('Do you have another expenses? ' +
                    '(Enter y for yes, enter 0 for no): ')
while True: 
  another == 0
  break
if total > budget:
    print(f'You are ${total - budget} over the budget ')
elif total == budget:
    print(f'Your budget is enough for expenses!')
else:
    print(f'You are ${total - budget} under the budget ')
